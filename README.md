# ComputerCraft Easy Turtles

ComputerCraft turtles are a great way to automate your Minecraft world. Configurable like nothing else, they can be used to build, mine, farm, and more. 

However, the provided API is very basic, and programs can quickly become very long and difficult to read. 

In this repository, I provide a set of high level functions that make it easier and shorter to write programs for turtles, with a focus on readability and maintainability.

## Please note

This project is currently in development, and some functions may not work as expected. If you find a bug, please report it in the issues section.

## Documentation

The documentation isn't built yet, however it can be generated using [LDoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/LDoc).

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `programs` folder. Some are very basic, others are more complex.

I will add very basic examples in a dedicated folder soon.

## Contributing
